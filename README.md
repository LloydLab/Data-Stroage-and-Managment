## Publishing the instructions website

This repository is configured to publish the Markdown files under `instructions/` as a website using MkDocs.

How to enable GitHub Pages the first time:

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.
2. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings → Pages.
3. Under "Build and deployment", set Source to "GitHub Actions". Save.
4. A workflow named "Deploy MkDocs site to GitHub Pages" will run on each push to `main`.
5. When it finishes, your site will be available at `https://<your-org-or-user>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Local preview (optional):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Then open the local link shown (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
