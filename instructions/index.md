# Welcome

This site contains practical, plain-language guides for managing and storing research data in the Lloyd Lab.

## Who should read this?

**All Llyod lab members should read through these instructions to understand our data management practices. They expectation is that everyone follows these practices to ensure data integrity, reproducibility, and collaboration.** If you are new to the lab, please read through all the sections relevant to your role.

## Why is this important?
Proper data management is crucial for several reasons:

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered over time.
- **Reproducibility:** Facilitates the ability to reproduce results by maintaining organized and well-documented data.
- **Collaboration:** Makes it easier for team members to find and use shared data.
- **Compliance:** Meets institutional and funding agency requirements for data handling and storage.
- **Efficiency:** Saves time and resources by preventing data loss and reducing redundancy.

If you are not storing and managing data properly, **you risk losing valuable research data**, facing difficulties in reproducing experiments, and hindering collaboration within the lab.

##  Getting started

Start with any page from the menu at the top. Suggested starting points:
