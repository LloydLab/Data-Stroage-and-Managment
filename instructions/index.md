# Welcome

This site contains practical, plain-language guides for managing and storing research data in the Lloyd Lab.

Who is this for? Anyone in the lab â€” no coding experience required.

Start with any page from the menu at the top. Suggested starting points:

- Action plan: a short checklist to get you set up quickly
- Project structure: where files should go and why
- Backups: how we keep data safe

If you get stuck or something is unclear, please contact the Data Steward listed on the Help page of the main README.
