## 🎯 KEY CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### Challenge 1: **Running Out of Space** ⚠️
**Current state:** 2TB RDS storage, generating large imaging data biweekly  

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ Compress old imaging data (300-500GB recovery)
2. ✅ Archive completed projects externally (200-300GB recovery)
3. ✅ Remove redundant processed files (100-200GB recovery)
4. ✅ Set up automated storage monitoring

### Challenge 2: **Backup/Redundancy** 💾
**Current state:** No backup strategy  
**Target:** 3-2-1 backup rule (3 copies, 2 media, 1 offsite)  

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ Identify key storage locations (OneDrive, RDS personal, RDS projects, external hardrives)
2. ✅ Create hierarchy of data storage for key datasets (confocal, flow cytometry, IMC, RNAseq, spatial transcriptomics) 
4. ✅ Create disaster recovery protocol

### Challenge 3: **Lack of Organization** 📁
**Current state:** Unclear where files should go  
**Target:** Standardized directory structure with enforcement  

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ Deploy mandatory directory template
2. ✅ Create "Where does this go?" decision tree
3. ✅ Implement monthly organization compliance checks
4. ✅ Migrate existing data to new structure

### Challenge 4: **Clear Structure/Guidelines** 📋
**Current state:** No documented protocols  
**Target:** Simple, enforceable one-page guides  

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ Create quick-reference cards (starting project, saving data, monthly hygiene)
2. ✅ Establish mandatory naming conventions
3. ✅ Set up automated validation tools
4. ✅ Train all lab members (1-hour session)

### Space Recovery
- [ ] Compress 5 largest old imaging datasets
- [ ] Move completed projects to archive staging
- [ ] Delete temporary analysis files from all projects

### Backup Setup
- [ ] Connect external HDD
- [ ] Install backup automation scripts
- [ ] Run first full backup
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

### Organization Rollout
