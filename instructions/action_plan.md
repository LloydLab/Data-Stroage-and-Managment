## 💾 SOLUTION 1: SPACE RECOVERY

#### Action 1: Compress Old Imaging Data (Expected: 300-500GB recovery)

**What to compress:**
- All microscopy images older than 1 year
- All folders from past personel
- IMC data from completed experiments
- Any TIFF files not currently being analyzed

**How to compress:**
```bash
# Quick compression of TIFF files
find /path/to/imaging -name "*.tif" -mtime +180 -exec python compress_image.py {} \;
```
`compress_image.py` located in ADD/PATH/TO/FILE

**Expected results:**
- 30-50% size reduction with lossless compression
- No quality loss, maintains all metadata

#### Action 2: Archive Completed Projects

**What to archive:**
- Published papers (raw data already deposited in public repos)
- Failed experiments (documented but not analyzed further)
- Superseded preliminary data

**Where to archive:**
- External hard drive
- Institutional archive service (check if available)

**Archive process:**
1. Copy to external storage (with checksum verification)
2. Compress before archiving (ZIP with medium compression)
3. Keep compressed copy on RDS for 30 days
4. Delete from active RDS after verification period

#### Action 3: Remove Redundant Files (Expected: 100-200GB recovery)

**Safe to delete:**
- ❌ Multiple versions of processed data (keep only: raw + final processed + analysis)
- ❌ Intermediate analysis files (Jupyter notebook outputs, cache files)
- ❌ QC plots and reports (keep summary only, regenerate if needed)
- ❌ Duplicate files from failed transfers (use fdupes to find)
- ❌ Temporary files in /tmp directories never cleaned

**How to identify:**
```bash
# Find duplicate files
fdupes -r /path/to/RDS > duplicates.txt

# Find large files not accessed in 180 days
find /path/to/RDS -type f -size +100M -atime +180 -ls > large_old_files.txt

# Find jupyter checkpoint files
find /path/to/RDS -name ".ipynb_checkpoints" -type d -exec du -sh {} \;
```

#### Action 4: Set Up Storage Monitoring (Prevent future crises)

**Automated weekly monitoring:**
- Check total storage usage
- Alert when exceeds 80% capacity (warning)
- Alert when exceeds 90% capacity (critical)
- Email report to Data Steward and PI
